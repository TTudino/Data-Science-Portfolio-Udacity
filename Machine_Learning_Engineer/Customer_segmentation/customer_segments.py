# Welcome to the third project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!
# 
# In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.

# ## Getting Started
# 
# In this project, you will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in *monetary units*) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.
# 
# The dataset for this project can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers). For the purposes of this project, the features `'Channel'` and `'Region'` will be excluded in the analysis â€” with focus instead on the six product categories recorded for customers.
# 
# Run the code block below to load the wholesale customers dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported.

# In[1]:


# Import libraries necessary for this project
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display # Allows the use of display() for DataFrames

# Import supplementary visualizations code visuals.py
import visuals as vs

# Pretty display for notebooks
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')

# Load the wholesale customers dataset
try:
    data = pd.read_csv("customers.csv")
    data.drop(['Region', 'Channel'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
    print("Wholesale customers dataset has {} samples with {} features each.".format(*data.shape))
except:
    print("Dataset could not be loaded. Is the dataset missing?")


# ## Data Exploration
# In this section, you will begin exploring the data through visualizations and code to understand how each feature is related to the others. You will observe a statistical description of the dataset, consider the relevance of each feature, and select a few sample data points from the dataset which you will track through the course of this project.
# 
# Run the code block below to observe a statistical description of the dataset. Note that the dataset is composed of six important product categories: **'Fresh'**, **'Milk'**, **'Grocery'**, **'Frozen'**, **'Detergents_Paper'**, and **'Delicatessen'**. Consider what each category represents in terms of products you could purchase.

# In[2]:


# Display a description of the dataset
display(data.describe())


# ### Implementation: Selecting Samples
# To get a better understanding of the customers and how their data will transform through the analysis, it would be best to select a few sample data points and explore them in more detail. In the code block below, add **three** indices of your choice to the `indices` list which will represent the customers to track. It is suggested to try different sets of samples until you obtain customers that vary significantly from one another.

# In[3]:


# TODO: Select three indices of your choice you wish to sample from the dataset
indices = [110, 30, 256]

# Create a DataFrame of the chosen samples
samples = pd.DataFrame(data.loc[indices], columns = data.keys()).reset_index(drop = True)
print("Chosen samples of wholesale customers dataset:")
display(samples)


# ### Question 1
# Consider the total purchase cost of each product category and the statistical description of the dataset above for your sample customers.  
# 
# * What kind of establishment (customer) could each of the three samples you've chosen represent?
# 
# **Hint:** Examples of establishments include places like markets, cafes, delis, wholesale retailers, among many others. Avoid using names for establishments, such as saying *"McDonalds"* when describing a sample customer as a restaurant. You can use the mean values for reference to compare your samples with. The mean values are as follows:
# 
# * Fresh: 12000.2977
# * Milk: 5796.2
# * Grocery: 7951.3
# * Detergents_paper: 2881.4
# * Delicatessen: 1524.8
# 
# Knowing this, how do your samples compare? Does that help in driving your insight into what kind of establishments they might be? 
# 

# **Answer:**
# 
# After analysing the initial dataset, I believe the first customer, which is represented by the data in the first row of the dataframe, may be a fruit/veg retailer owing to the spent on Fresh and Delicatessen products that is in line with the dataset mean values, while all other products are below the respective means. The second customer might be a supermarket, having all products spent around or over the mean values. The final one could be a patisserie, where all primary resource requests are within the associated averaged values while the secondary production (e.g. delicatessen) is below the average. 

# ### Implementation: Feature Relevance
# One interesting thought to consider is if one (or more) of the six product categories is actually relevant for understanding customer purchasing. That is to say, is it possible to determine whether customers purchasing some amount of one category of products will necessarily purchase some proportional amount of another category of products? We can make this determination quite easily by training a supervised regression learner on a subset of the data with one feature removed, and then score how well that model can predict the removed feature.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Assign `new_data` a copy of the data by removing a feature of your choice using the `DataFrame.drop` function.
#  - Use `sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split` to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
#    - Use the removed feature as your target label. Set a `test_size` of `0.25` and set a `random_state`.
#  - Import a decision tree regressor, set a `random_state`, and fit the learner to the training data.
#  - Report the prediction score of the testing set using the regressor's `score` function.

# In[4]:


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

# TODO: Make a copy of the DataFrame, using the 'drop' function to drop the given feature
new_data = data.copy()
new_data.drop(['Fresh'], axis=1, inplace = True)

# TODO: Split the data into training and testing sets(0.25) using the given feature as the target
# Set a random state.
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(new_data, data['Fresh'], test_size = 0.25, random_state = 1)

# TODO: Create a decision tree regressor and fit it to the training set
regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state = 1)
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# TODO: Report the score of the prediction using the testing set
score = regressor.score(X_test, y_test)
print(score)


# ### Question 2
# 
# * Which feature did you attempt to predict? 
# * What was the reported prediction score? 
# * Is this feature necessary for identifying customers' spending habits?
# 
# **Hint:** The coefficient of determination, `R^2`, is scored between 0 and 1, with 1 being a perfect fit. A negative `R^2` implies the model fails to fit the data. If you get a low score for a particular feature, that lends us to beleive that that feature point is hard to predict using the other features, thereby making it an important feature to consider when considering relevance.

# **Answer:**
# 
# In this analysis, I attempted to predict the amount spent by each customer for 'Fresh' products. The model performance resulted in a score of -0.92, which is a clear indication that the variable is important for the dataset and other fields cannot be used to predict it via a machine learning algorithm such as a decision tree regressor.

# ### Visualize Feature Distributions
# To get a better understanding of the dataset, we can construct a scatter matrix of each of the six product features present in the data. If you found that the feature you attempted to predict above is relevant for identifying a specific customer, then the scatter matrix below may not show any correlation between that feature and the others. Conversely, if you believe that feature is not relevant for identifying a specific customer, the scatter matrix might show a correlation between that feature and another feature in the data. Run the code block below to produce a scatter matrix.

# In[5]:


from pandas.plotting import scatter_matrix
# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of features in the data
scatter_matrix(data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');


# In[6]:


# Print the correlation coefficient among product pairs
corr = data.corr()
print(corr)


# ### Question 3
# * Using the scatter matrix as a reference, discuss the distribution of the dataset, specifically talk about the normality, outliers, large number of data points near 0 among others. If you need to sepearate out some of the plots individually to further accentuate your point, you may do so as well.
# * Are there any pairs of features which exhibit some degree of correlation? 
# * Does this confirm or deny your suspicions about the relevance of the feature you attempted to predict? 
# * How is the data for those features distributed?
# 
# **Hint:** Is the data normally distributed? Where do most of the data points lie? You can use [corr()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html) to get the feature correlations and then visualize them using a [heatmap](http://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html)(the data that would be fed into the heatmap would be the correlation values, for eg: `data.corr()`) to gain further insight.

# **Answer:**
# 
# By looking at the curves plotted in the scatter matrix above, it appears clear that all products are skewed towards low amounts spent, hence not being normally distributed. Most of the data are distributed around the zero, showing that only specialised customers would require high volumes of specific products. Furthermore, the amount of some products is clearly correlated (e.g. Grocery and Detergent_Paper), while other scatter plots reflect the lack of correlations (e.g. Grocery and Delicatessen). These conclusions are supported by the correlation coefficients estimated for the mentioned product pairs as 0.93 and 0.21. As a result, I strongly believe that not all of the products are necessary to train a model, as the distribution of some could be infer from other products. However, the amount of money spent for Fresh product might be one of the necessary feature as none of the other product values correlate with it, supporting the conclusion of the previous analyses.   

# ## Data Preprocessing
# In this section, you will preprocess the data to create a better representation of customers by performing a scaling on the data and detecting (and optionally removing) outliers. Preprocessing data is often times a critical step in assuring that results you obtain from your analysis are significant and meaningful.

# ### Implementation: Feature Scaling
# If data is not normally distributed, especially if the mean and median vary significantly (indicating a large skew), it is most [often appropriate](http://econbrowser.com/archives/2014/02/use-of-logarithms-in-economics) to apply a non-linear scaling â€” particularly for financial data. One way to achieve this scaling is by using a [Box-Cox test](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html), which calculates the best power transformation of the data that reduces skewness. A simpler approach which can work in most cases would be applying the natural logarithm.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Assign a copy of the data to `log_data` after applying logarithmic scaling. Use the `np.log` function for this.
#  - Assign a copy of the sample data to `log_samples` after applying logarithmic scaling. Again, use `np.log`.

# In[7]:


# TODO: Scale the data using the natural logarithm
log_data = np.log(data)

# TODO: Scale the sample data using the natural logarithm
log_samples = np.log(samples)

# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of newly-transformed features
scatter_matrix(log_data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');


# ### Observation
# After applying a natural logarithm scaling to the data, the distribution of each feature should appear much more normal. For any pairs of features you may have identified earlier as being correlated, observe here whether that correlation is still present (and whether it is now stronger or weaker than before).
# 
# Run the code below to see how the sample data has changed after having the natural logarithm applied to it.

# In[8]:


# Display the log-transformed sample data
display(log_samples)


# ### Implementation: Outlier Detection
# Detecting outliers in the data is extremely important in the data preprocessing step of any analysis. The presence of outliers can often skew results which take into consideration these data points. There are many "rules of thumb" for what constitutes an outlier in a dataset. Here, we will use [Tukey's Method for identfying outliers](http://datapigtechnologies.com/blog/index.php/highlighting-outliers-in-your-data-with-the-tukey-method/): An *outlier step* is calculated as 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR). A data point with a feature that is beyond an outlier step outside of the IQR for that feature is considered abnormal.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Assign the value of the 25th percentile for the given feature to `Q1`. Use `np.percentile` for this.
#  - Assign the value of the 75th percentile for the given feature to `Q3`. Again, use `np.percentile`.
#  - Assign the calculation of an outlier step for the given feature to `step`.
#  - Optionally remove data points from the dataset by adding indices to the `outliers` list.
# 
# **NOTE:** If you choose to remove any outliers, ensure that the sample data does not contain any of these points!  
# Once you have performed this implementation, the dataset will be stored in the variable `good_data`.

# In[9]:


from collections import Counter

# For each feature find the data points with extreme high or low values
for feature in log_data.keys():
    
    # TODO: Calculate Q1 (25th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q1 = np.percentile(log_data[feature], 25)
    
    # TODO: Calculate Q3 (75th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q3 = np.percentile(log_data[feature], 75)
    
    # TODO: Use the interquartile range to calculate an outlier step (1.5 times the interquartile range)
    step = (Q3 - Q1) * 1.5
    
    # Display the outliers
    print("Data points considered outliers for the feature '{}':".format(feature))
    display(log_data[~((log_data[feature] >= Q1 - step) & (log_data[feature] <= Q3 + step))])
    
# OPTIONAL: Select the indices for data points you wish to remove
outliers  = []

# Remove the outliers, if any were specified
good_data = log_data.drop(log_data.index[outliers]).reset_index(drop = True)


# ### Question 4
# * Are there any data points considered outliers for more than one feature based on the definition above? 
# * Should these data points be removed from the dataset? 
# * If any data points were added to the `outliers` list to be removed, explain why.
# 
# ** Hint: ** If you have datapoints that are outliers in multiple categories think about why that may be and if they warrant removal. Also note how k-means is affected by outliers and whether or not this plays a factor in your analysis of whether or not to remove them.

# **Answer:**
# 
# The analysis shown above reveal the existence of multiple outliers in the six product spent distributions. Some of them are recurrent across multiple products, such as line 154 that is an outlier for both 'Milk' and 'Grocery'. Other recurrent outliers are lines 65, 66, 75, and 128.   
# 
# All of those data should be removed as they could affect the training of any model and so skew the outcomes. In particular, the rows that recur across multiple products must be removed as they are influent on multiple distributions. For instance, outliers can move the centre of the clusters identified from an e.g. k-means algorithm influencing the accuracy of the final outcome.

# ## Feature Transformation
# In this section you will use principal component analysis (PCA) to draw conclusions about the underlying structure of the wholesale customer data. Since using PCA on a dataset calculates the dimensions which best maximize variance, we will find which compound combinations of features best describe customers.

# ### Implementation: PCA
# 
# Now that the data has been scaled to a more normal distribution and has had any necessary outliers removed, we can now apply PCA to the `good_data` to discover which dimensions about the data best maximize the variance of features involved. In addition to finding these dimensions, PCA will also report the *explained variance ratio* of each dimension â€” how much variance within the data is explained by that dimension alone. Note that a component (dimension) from PCA can be considered a new "feature" of the space, however it is a composition of the original features present in the data.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Import `sklearn.decomposition.PCA` and assign the results of fitting PCA in six dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
#  - Apply a PCA transformation of `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.

# In[10]:


from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# TODO: Apply PCA by fitting the good data with the same number of dimensions as features
pca = PCA(n_components=6)
pca.fit(good_data)

# TODO: Transform log_samples using the PCA fit above
pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples)

# Generate PCA results plot
pca_results = vs.pca_results(good_data, pca)


# ### Question 5
# 
# * How much variance in the data is explained* **in total** *by the first and second principal component? 
# * How much variance in the data is explained by the first four principal components? 
# * Using the visualization provided above, talk about each dimension and the cumulative variance explained by each, stressing upon which features are well represented by each dimension(both in terms of positive and negative variance explained). Discuss what the first four dimensions best represent in terms of customer spending.
# 
# **Hint:** A positive increase in a specific dimension corresponds with an *increase* of the *positive-weighted* features and a *decrease* of the *negative-weighted* features. The rate of increase or decrease is based on the individual feature weights.

# **Answer:**
# 
# Together, the first and second dimensions explain 71.9% (44.2% + 27.7%) of the dataset variance. If we add the third and fourth dimensions, the explained variance increases to 93.1%, being acceptable for a potential dimensionality reduction. More in details, it is possible to summarise the influence of each dimension as follows. 
# 
# (1) The first dimension describes significantly well the Detergent_Paper spent, including almost 80% of its variance, and covers also the Grocery and Milk spent distributions, including roughly 50% of the variance of each. 
# 
# (2) The second dimension describes the Fresh, Frozen, and Delicatessen spent variances with roughly the same accuracy (between 50% and 60%) for each, while it does not include any of the other product changes.
# 
# (3) The third dimension pairs the Fresh and Detergent_Paper spent variances over the negative index and the Frozen and Delicatessen spent changes over the positive axis. The other products are not well captured by this dimension.
# 
# (4) The fourth dimension highlights the variances of the Frozen and and Delicatessen spent amounts, respectively on the positive and negative axes, while all of the other product changes are considered of less relevance.

# ### Observation
# Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it in six dimensions. Observe the numerical value for the first four dimensions of the sample points. Consider if this is consistent with your initial interpretation of the sample points.

# In[11]:


# Display sample log-data after having a PCA transformation applied
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = pca_results.index.values))


# ### Implementation: Dimensionality Reduction
# When using principal component analysis, one of the main goals is to reduce the dimensionality of the data â€” in effect, reducing the complexity of the problem. Dimensionality reduction comes at a cost: Fewer dimensions used implies less of the total variance in the data is being explained. Because of this, the *cumulative explained variance ratio* is extremely important for knowing how many dimensions are necessary for the problem. Additionally, if a signifiant amount of variance is explained by only two or three dimensions, the reduced data can be visualized afterwards.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Assign the results of fitting PCA in two dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
#  - Apply a PCA transformation of `good_data` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `reduced_data`.
#  - Apply a PCA transformation of `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.

# In[12]:


# TODO: Apply PCA by fitting the good data with only two dimensions
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca.fit(good_data)

# TODO: Transform the good data using the PCA fit above
reduced_data = pca.transform(good_data)

# TODO: Transform log_samples using the PCA fit above
pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples)

# Create a DataFrame for the reduced data
reduced_data = pd.DataFrame(reduced_data, columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2'])


# ### Observation
# Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it using only two dimensions. Observe how the values for the first two dimensions remains unchanged when compared to a PCA transformation in six dimensions.

# In[13]:


# Display sample log-data after applying PCA transformation in two dimensions
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2']))


# ## Visualizing a Biplot
# A biplot is a scatterplot where each data point is represented by its scores along the principal components. The axes are the principal components (in this case `Dimension 1` and `Dimension 2`). In addition, the biplot shows the projection of the original features along the components. A biplot can help us interpret the reduced dimensions of the data, and discover relationships between the principal components and original features.
# 
# Run the code cell below to produce a biplot of the reduced-dimension data.

# In[14]:


# Create a biplot
vs.biplot(good_data, reduced_data, pca)


# ### Observation
# 
# Once we have the original feature projections (in red), it is easier to interpret the relative position of each data point in the scatterplot. For instance, a point the lower right corner of the figure will likely correspond to a customer that spends a lot on `'Milk'`, `'Grocery'` and `'Detergents_Paper'`, but not so much on the other product categories. 
# 
# From the biplot, which of the original features are most strongly correlated with the first component? What about those that are associated with the second component? Do these observations agree with the pca_results plot you obtained earlier?

# ## Clustering
# 
# In this section, you will choose to use either a K-Means clustering algorithm or a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm to identify the various customer segments hidden in the data. You will then recover specific data points from the clusters to understand their significance by transforming them back into their original dimension and scale. 

# ### Question 6
# 
# * What are the advantages to using a K-Means clustering algorithm? 
# * What are the advantages to using a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm? 
# * Given your observations about the wholesale customer data so far, which of the two algorithms will you use and why?
# 
# ** Hint: ** Think about the differences between hard clustering and soft clustering and which would be appropriate for our dataset.

# **Answer:**
# 
# The k-means is a clustering algorithm used for unsupervised that is easy to implement, always converge, scales well to a large data sample, and allows an instance to change cluster when the centroids are recalculated. However, this algorithm includes the following disadvantages: it is challenging to predict the exact number of clusters, the choice of initial seeds could have an impact on the final result, changes in the dataset (e.g. log scale) will influence the algorithm results. The Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a generalisation of the k-means algorithm also used for unsupervised classification. The GMM estimates the probability that a point belongs to one or another cluster and so is useful where hidden clusters are possible; the GMM does not require the data to be normally distributed and it is generally quicker than the k-means alternative. However, the GMM is more trivial to set and it suffers of the possibility of getting stuck on a local minima and so not fully converge. Furthermore, the GMM relies on a soft clustering, where a dataset point may be included in multiple clusters with an associated variation in the probability. Although this is a very good feature in some cases, it might be not useful for the present project within which a hard clustering is required (a point has to be in either one or another cluster). Taking all these aspects into account and considering the analyses done so far, I believe the best choice for the analysis to come is the K-means clustering.    

# ### Implementation: Creating Clusters
# Depending on the problem, the number of clusters that you expect to be in the data may already be known. When the number of clusters is not known *a priori*, there is no guarantee that a given number of clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure exists in the data â€” if any. However, we can quantify the "goodness" of a clustering by calculating each data point's *silhouette coefficient*. The [silhouette coefficient](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html) for a data point measures how similar it is to its assigned cluster from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (similar). Calculating the *mean* silhouette coefficient provides for a simple scoring method of a given clustering.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Fit a clustering algorithm to the `reduced_data` and assign it to `clusterer`.
#  - Predict the cluster for each data point in `reduced_data` using `clusterer.predict` and assign them to `preds`.
#  - Find the cluster centers using the algorithm's respective attribute and assign them to `centers`.
#  - Predict the cluster for each sample data point in `pca_samples` and assign them `sample_preds`.
#  - Import `sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score` and calculate the silhouette score of `reduced_data` against `preds`.
#    - Assign the silhouette score to `score` and print the result.

# In[15]:


from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# TODO: Apply your clustering algorithm of choice to the reduced data 
clusterer = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=1)
clusterer.fit(reduced_data)

# TODO: Predict the cluster for each data point
preds = clusterer.predict(reduced_data)

# TODO: Find the cluster centers
centers = clusterer.cluster_centers_

# TODO: Predict the cluster for each transformed sample data point
sample_preds = clusterer.predict(pca_samples)

# TODO: Calculate the mean silhouette coefficient for the number of clusters chosen
score = silhouette_score(reduced_data, preds, random_state=1)
print(score)


# ### Question 7
# 
# * Report the silhouette score for several cluster numbers you tried. 
# * Of these, which number of clusters has the best silhouette score?

# **Answer:**
# 
# In order to find the most functional clusters amount for the study, I try different values and of report hereafter the results: 
# 
# (A) two clusters lead to a score of 0.4192
# 
# (B) three clusters lead to a score of 0.3943
# 
# (C) four clusters lead to a score of 0.3302
# 
# (D) five clusters lead to a score of 0.3478
# 
# (E) ten clusters lead to a score of 0.3653
# 
# (F) twenty clusters lead to a score of 0.3435
# 
# (G) hundred clusters lead to a score of 0.3617
# 
# Among all of the score values reported above, the most functional solution is the use of two clusters.

# ### Cluster Visualization
# Once you've chosen the optimal number of clusters for your clustering algorithm using the scoring metric above, you can now visualize the results by executing the code block below. Note that, for experimentation purposes, you are welcome to adjust the number of clusters for your clustering algorithm to see various visualizations. The final visualization provided should, however, correspond with the optimal number of clusters. 

# In[16]:


# Display the results of the clustering from implementation
vs.cluster_results(reduced_data, preds, centers, pca_samples)


# ### Implementation: Data Recovery
# Each cluster present in the visualization above has a central point. These centers (or means) are not specifically data points from the data, but rather the *averages* of all the data points predicted in the respective clusters. For the problem of creating customer segments, a cluster's center point corresponds to *the average customer of that segment*. Since the data is currently reduced in dimension and scaled by a logarithm, we can recover the representative customer spending from these data points by applying the inverse transformations.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Apply the inverse transform to `centers` using `pca.inverse_transform` and assign the new centers to `log_centers`.
#  - Apply the inverse function of `np.log` to `log_centers` using `np.exp` and assign the true centers to `true_centers`.
# 

# In[17]:


# TODO: Inverse transform the centers
log_centers = pca.inverse_transform(centers)

# TODO: Exponentiate the centers
true_centers = np.exp(log_centers)

# Display the true centers
segments = ['Segment {}'.format(i) for i in range(0,len(centers))]
true_centers = pd.DataFrame(np.round(true_centers), columns = data.keys())
true_centers.index = segments
display(true_centers)

# ### Question 8
# 
# * Consider the total purchase cost of each product category for the representative data points above, and reference the statistical description of the dataset at the beginning of this project(specifically looking at the mean values for the various feature points). What set of establishments could each of the customer segments represent?
# 
# **Hint:** A customer who is assigned to `'Cluster X'` should best identify with the establishments represented by the feature set of `'Segment X'`. Think about what each segment represents in terms their values for the feature points chosen. Reference these values with the mean values to get some perspective into what kind of establishment they represent.

# **Answer:**
# 
# The customer segmentation classifies each customer in respect to where the amount spent for each product purchase fits in the dataset distribution. For istance, it is possible to state that Cluster 0 would include an amount of Fresh product spent that lie in the second quartile, being included between 3127.75 and 8504.0. More in details, we could state that: 
# 
# (Segment 0) the customers included in the segment 0 generally spend on Fresh and Frozen products an amount of money that is lower than the average but higher than the 25th percentile. Milk, Grocery, and Detergent_Paper products are included in the greatest quartile, with values greater than the 75th percentile and lower than the maximum. The Delicatessen spent is however included in the third quartile, showing a distribution different from any other product for this segment. Overall, it is possible to conclude that segment 0 describes small supermarkets or small retailers mostly focused on the sell of food of primary necessity (Fresh products).
# 
# (Segment 1) The customers included in the segment 1 spend an amount of money for Fresh and Frozen products included between the averages and the 75th percentile, which lie in the third quartile of the data distribution. The rest of the product spents are included in the second quartile, hence being lower than the dataset average values. This combination of product spent amounts might suggest a chain of cafe, which may need fresh and frozen items in high quantity and low values of the other products.

# ### Question 9
# 
# * For each sample point, which customer segment from* **Question 8** *best represents it? 
# * Are the predictions for each sample point consistent with this?*
# 
# Run the code block below to find which cluster each sample point is predicted to be.

# In[19]:


# Display the predictions
for i, pred in enumerate(sample_preds):
    print("Sample point", i, "predicted to be in Cluster", pred)


# **Answer:**
# 
# Sample 0 shows a high proportion of Fresh and Frozen products spent, hence being correctly classified in Cluster 1.
# 
# Sample 1 shows a high proportion of Fresh and Grocery products spent, hence being correctly classified in Cluetsr 0.
# 
# Sample 2 however shows a high amount of Fresh product spent, which is consistent with Cluster 1, but a relatively low amount of money spent for Frozen products, hence not being correctly classified. 

# ## Conclusion

# In this final section, you will investigate ways that you can make use of the clustered data. First, you will consider how the different groups of customers, the ***customer segments***, may be affected differently by a specific delivery scheme. Next, you will consider how giving a label to each customer (which *segment* that customer belongs to) can provide for additional features about the customer data. Finally, you will compare the ***customer segments*** to a hidden variable present in the data, to see whether the clustering identified certain relationships.

# ### Question 10
# Companies will often run [A/B tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) when making small changes to their products or services to determine whether making that change will affect its customers positively or negatively. The wholesale distributor is considering changing its delivery service from currently 5 days a week to 3 days a week. However, the distributor will only make this change in delivery service for customers that react positively. 
# 
# * How can the wholesale distributor use the customer segments to determine which customers, if any, would react positively to the change in delivery service?*
# 
# **Hint:** Can we assume the change affects all customers equally? How can we determine which group of customers it affects the most?

# **Answer:**
# 
# In order to apply an A/B test, the customers can be divided into two comparably large groups (named Group A and Group B), each of which includes 220 customers (50% of the total) randomly selected between the two identified segments. This equal split will assure comparability in between the control and test group and increase the result accuracy.
# 
# Group A would be used as control, not being impacted by any change and receiving the five days delivery already in place. Group B would represent the test group, receiving the new delivery service that will be provided three days a week. After at least two weeks, which is the minimum for an A/B test to be considered reliable, differences in conversion rates would be analysed and compared both among groups and segments within each group. If those differences result significant within the method variance, then conclusions can be drawn on the effect of the changes in the delivery service.   
# 
# In term of reactions to the service changes, I would expect variations dependent on the total amount of items bought and their categorisation. For instance, customers that primarily received Detergent_Paper would have small or no discomfort due to changes in the delivery service, as the items are not perishable, and their conversion rate should remain unaltered. These customers could even react positively, depending on needs and storage capacity, potentially increasing the amount of money spent. Conversely, customers that primarily acquired perishable products (e.g. Fresh) would react negatively to the reduction in the amount of delivery days and potentially decrease their conversion rate. In the present study, I would expect the conversion rate of the customers in Segment 1 to be more influenced and reduce more than the customers in Segment 0 as the amount of perishable items (e.g. Frozen) is greater. 
# 
# To have a better understanding of the customers reaction to the changes in the product delivery system, additional A/B tests could be run for each product type. For instance, the amount of Fresh products is higher in Segment 1, but the amount of Milk bought is higher in Segment 0. Both items are perishable and hence it is challenging to identify the effect of the reduction in their delivery days if we do not separate the impact within two A/B tests: first we could reduce the amount of Fresh products provided to three days a week and secondly we could reduce the days when the Milk is provided. Following this approach, we could identify the impact of each item on the conversion rates. This approach is also interesting as it allows to identify potential interactive effects of the changes in the products provision on the customers' conversion rates.

# ### Question 11
# Additional structure is derived from originally unlabeled data when using clustering techniques. Since each customer has a ***customer segment*** it best identifies with (depending on the clustering algorithm applied), we can consider *'customer segment'* as an **engineered feature** for the data. Assume the wholesale distributor recently acquired ten new customers and each provided estimates for anticipated annual spending of each product category. Knowing these estimates, the wholesale distributor wants to classify each new customer to a ***customer segment*** to determine the most appropriate delivery service.  
# * How can the wholesale distributor label the new customers using only their estimated product spending and the **customer segment** data?
# 
# **Hint:** A supervised learner could be used to train on the original customers. What would be the target variable?

# **Answer:**
# 
# Having the customers segmentation based on the relative amount of money spent for each product, it is possible to classify new segments by using the spent on products purchases as predictors and the customer segment as predicted feature. This result can be achieved with any classifier.

# ### Visualizing Underlying Distributions
# 
# At the beginning of this project, it was discussed that the `'Channel'` and `'Region'` features would be excluded from the dataset so that the customer product categories were emphasized in the analysis. By reintroducing the `'Channel'` feature to the dataset, an interesting structure emerges when considering the same PCA dimensionality reduction applied earlier to the original dataset.
# 
# Run the code block below to see how each data point is labeled either `'HoReCa'` (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe) or `'Retail'` the reduced space. In addition, you will find the sample points are circled in the plot, which will identify their labeling.

# ### Question 12
# 
# * How well does the clustering algorithm and number of clusters you've chosen compare to this underlying distribution of Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers to Retailer customers? 
# * Are there customer segments that would be classified as purely 'Retailers' or 'Hotels/Restaurants/Cafes' by this distribution? 
# * Would you consider these classifications as consistent with your previous definition of the customer segments?

# **Answer:**
# 
# Having considered all aspects, I believe the algorithm does a reasonably good job on classifying two customer clusters within the analysed dataset. Roughly a third of the dataset may be classified wrongly by the initial algorithm being the data mixed over the two channels considered, but the remaining majority fits within the actual classifiaction. For instance, the point described by -1.8 (dimension 1) and 6.8 (dimension 2) lies within the Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe cluster, while it is classified in the same cluster as the point (-4.4, 0.3) by the built algorithm. Notwisthstanding that, there is a general difference between two behaviours in the customers that is reasonably well captured by the build algorithm and compares with the actual data.
