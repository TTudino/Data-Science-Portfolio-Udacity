    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like.

    "\n",
    "The choice of the best model to identify the individuals that earn more than 50K depends on several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and some considerations. As an initial step, it is useful to evaluate the fraction of true positive over the predicted positive values (precision) and the fraction of predicted positive values over the actual positive values (recall). The ratio among these indicators is called F-score and it is the first KPI used in this analysis. We estimate the F-score on the test dataset after trained a Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), K Neighbors Classifier (KNC), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models on the data totality. This preliminary analysis leads to the following:\n",
    "- DTC: 0.629 \n",
    "- KNC: 0.639\n",
    "- SVM: 0.674\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVM model shows the highest F-score, reaching 67.4% and hence resulting the most appropriate to use. The KNC model is the second one in the rank (63.9%), while the DTC is associated to the lowest F-score value (62.9%), although the difference between the last two might be not significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having analysed the F-score estimates, we focus on the evaluation of the model accuracy. This KPI returns the fraction of correctly classified values, which is:\n",
    "- DTC: 0.819\n",
    "- KNC: 0.824\n",
    "- SVM: 0.837\n",
    "\n",
    "In agreement with the F-score estimates, the SVM model is the most efficient, classifying approximately 84% of the data correctly. The KNC is the second in the rank, classifying correctly 1.5% less data. The DTC is the least efficient, with the accuracy being 0.819.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Preliminary conclusion:* \n",
    "\n",
    "the SVC model seems to be the most efficient for the study case, being associated to the highest F-score and accuracy. This conclusion is additionally supported by the high F-score and accuracy values shown in the upper central and right graphs in the panels above for the DTC and KNC models, which highligth potential overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Additional considerations:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Notwithstanding the results highlighted in the previous paragraph, the F-score and accuracy estimates cannot be used alone to decide the most efficient model. It is also important to evaluate the amount of computer power required by each model to reach an acceptable performance. This information is stored in the left graphs in the panels above and evidences that the SVC requires roughly 100 times more time to run on the training data than the other two models. The SVC is also one order of magnitude slower than the DTC model on the test data, although the KNC model is the slowest in this occasion. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Final conclusion:*\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVC model is the most efficient model for the study case analysed in this jupyter notebook, but this model requires a significant amount of computer time to run. If a fast solution is required, I suggest the use of the KNC model, which reduces slighltly the accuracy and F-score but limits the requested computer time by a facotr of 1.5.   \n",
    "\n",
    "*Algorithm suitability:*\n",
    "\n",
    "As summarised before in this document, the SVC model is useful to solve the study case and identify the individuals that earn more the 50K. This algorithm is mostly usable for classification cases with two classes; it works quite well with large datasets that do not reach a treshold of 100000 values and have a large amount of features (around 50). \n",

    "\n",
    "The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm usable to separate data classes (classification) or quantify continuous values from predictive variables (regression).

    "\n",
    "*Algorithm summary:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Giving a dataset that needs to be classified, the SVM algorithm identifies a hyper plane that separates the data into two classes (e.g. income higher and lower than 50K). This hyper plane can be thought as a line in a 2-D space and the associated confidence is directly correlated with the distance of the border data from the plane.\n",

    "The SVM application relies on subsequent steps:\n",

    "- the data are splitted randomly between a train and test datasets;\n",
    "- the train dataset is used to identify several possible hyper planes and select the one that minimises the error;\n",

    "Surprisingly, however, nor the person sex or the specific occupation lie among the five most correlated features. The amount of capital loss and gain seem to better describe the variance in the predicted variable. This might be supported by the fact that higher incomes allow people to risk more and to support higher changes in their capital. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
