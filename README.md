# Data-Science-Portfolio-Udacity
This repository includes all of the projects done throughout my two Udacity Nanodegrees: the `Data Analyst` and the `Machine Learning Egineer`. 

## Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree
This nanodegree aims to advance your programming skills and refine your ability to work with messy, complex datasets. You will learn to manipulate and prepare data for analysis, and create visualizations for data exploration. Finally, you will learn to use your data skills to tell a story with data (https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002?utm_source=gsem_brand&utm_medium=ads&utm_campaign=949641074_c&utm_term=45317432297_eu&utm_keyword=udacity%20data%20analyst%20nanodegree_e&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhbCj6sPQ5AIVTLTtCh0JqgF3EAAYASAAEgK8c_D_BwE).

### Project 1: weather trend analysis
General analysis on the weather trends of several cities. The `Project1_Comparative_Assessment_Of_Thermal_Temporal_Changes` includes all of the necessary descriptions while the figures are reported separately, as asked by Udacity.

### Project 2: bike usage exploration 
This project aims to load and explore data concerning the US bike share systems of New York City, Washington DC, and Chicago from January to June 2017. All data, comments and code are reported into the `Project2_explore_bike_sharing_data` file.

### Project 3: movies popularity
This project aims to explore a public dataset on movies popularity and identify trends and patterns useful for actions. The data, comments and code are shown in the `Project3_Investigating_A_Dataset` file. 

### Project 4: A/B test on a new website
This project aims to explore the impact of a new website for an e-commerce. The applied A/B test is described in the `Project4_Analyze_AB_Test_Results` file together with the associated code and comments.

## Udacity Machine Learning Nano Degree
This nanodegree aims to teach advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms and how to package and deploy your models to a production environment. Teach practical experience using Amazon SageMaker to deploy trained models to a web application and evaluate the performance of your models. A/B test models and learn how to update the models as you gather more data, an important skill in industry (https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t?utm_source=gsem_brand&utm_medium=ads&utm_campaign=949641071_c&utm_term=47894921256_eu&utm_keyword=udacity%20machine%20learning_e&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1b3I6sXQ5AIVVuDtCh0-SA2cEAAYASAAEgLc0vD_BwE).

### Project 1: analysis of the Boston housing price
This project aims to evaluate the trends in the price of the Boston houses and build a model that could predict them based on e.g. the amount of rooms available. The comments and code are available in the `boston_housing_price` file that is available in both the py and ipynb formats.

### Project 2: finding donors
This project aims to classify potential donors based on their income in order to identify people that could be potential target for charity organisation. All the code used and associated comments are available in the `finding_donors` file that is available in both the py and ipynb formats.

### Project 3: Customer segmentation
This project aims to provide a reliable segmentation of the customer of a retailer based on their preference so to improve the delivery system. All code and associated comments are available in the `customer_segmentation` file that is available in both the py and ipynb formats.

### Project 4: Sentiment analysis on SageMaker
The goal of this project is to create a classification model that could separate movies review based on the text sentiments between positive and negative ones. This project is based on the use of the Amazon SageMaker, hence the running of it would require the setting of the AWS console. All code and associated comments are available in the `Sentiment_analysis_SageMaker` file that is available in both the py and ipynb formats. Additional files necessary for the model run are also provided in the folder.

### Project 5: Plagiarism detection on SageMaker
This project is also structured to run on Amazon SageMaker and aims to create a classification model that separates texts between the ones that include and the ones that do not include plagiarisms. All the code and associated comments are available in the `1_Data_Exploration`, `2_Plagiarism_Feature_Engineering`, and `3_Training_a_Model` files that are available in both the py and ipynb formats. Additional files necessary for the model run are also provided in the folder.
